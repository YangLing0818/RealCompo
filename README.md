Diffusion models have achieved remarkable advancements in text-to-image generation. However, existing models still have many difficulties when faced with multiple-object compositional generation. In this paper, we propose a new training-free and transferred-friendly text-to-image generation framework, namely RealCompo, which aims to leverage the advantages of text-to-image and layout-to-image models to enhance both realism and compositionality of the generated images. An intuitive and novel balancer is proposed to dynamically balance the strengths of the two models in denoising process, allowing plug-and-play use of any model without extra training. Extensive experiments show that our RealCompo consistently outperforms state-of-the-art text-to-image models and layout-to-image models in multiple-object compositional generation while keeping satisfactory realism and compositionality of the generated images.

## Introduction

![Alt text](image-1.png)

We introduce a new **training-free and transferred-friendly** text-to-image generation framework RealCompo that utilizes a novel balancer to achieve dynamic equilibrium between realism and compositionality in generated images.

## New Updates

**[2024.2]** Our main code of RealCompo v1 is released.

We demonstrate that RealCompo has strong generalization and generality to different models, achieving a remarkable level of both fidelity and precision in aligning with text prompts.

## Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/YangLing0818/RealCompo
cd RealCompo
conda create -n RealCompo python==3.8.10
conda activate RealCompo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Download models

We provide the code of RealCompo v1, which is composed of Stable Diffusion v1.5 and GLIGEN.

You should download the checkpoints of GLIGEN ([HF Hub](https://huggingface.co/gligen/gligen-generation-text-box/blob/main/diffusion_pytorch_model.bin)) put its path into  `inference.py`.

## Generating images with RealCompo v1

### Option 1: Use LLMs to reason out the layout

You can get the results through running: 

```bash
python inference.py --user_prompt 'a teddy bear sits left of a yellow bird' --api_key 'put your api_key here' 
```

**--user_prompt** is the original prompt that used to generate an image.

**--api_key** is needed if you use GPT-4.

**You can also use local LLMs to reason out layouts**. Example samples will be saved in `generation_samples`. You can check `inference.py` for more details about interface. 

```
generation_samples
├── generation_realcompo_v1_sd_gligen_a_teddy_bear_sits_left_of_a_yellow_bird
│   ├── 0.png
│   ├── 1.png
|   .....
......
```

### Option 2: Manually setting the layout

If you already have the layouts related to all objects, you can directly run:

```bash
python inference.py  --no_gpt --user_prompt 'a teddy bear sits left of a yellow bird' --object "['a teddy bear', 'a yellow bird']" --boundingbox "[[0.1, 0.1, 0.7, 0.9], [0.7, 0.1, 0.9, 0.4]]" --token_location "[3, 9]"
```

**--no_gpt** can be used when you have already obtained the layout.

**--object** represents the set of objects mentioned in the prompt.

**--boundingbox** represents the set of layout for each object.

**--token_location** represents the set of locations where each object appears in the prompt.



You can change the backbone of the T2I model to Stable Diffusion v1.4, TokenCompose, and so on. 

The core code for updating the models' coefficients is located in `ldm/models/diffusion/plms.py`. Using this code, you can make slight modifications to replace the L2I model with another one.
